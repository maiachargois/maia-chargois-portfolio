My Personal Portfolio
About
This is my personal portfolio showcasing all of my projects throughout my coding career. A portfolio is a great way for me to not only show off what I can do, but is also great to add on in the future when I do more projects and get more experience. It would be nice to look back at my starting projects and see what I can do to edit them or look back at how I coded. This portfolio gives me and future employers an easily accessible resource on what I can do and what projects I have been involved in. It's an organized page including a small summary about me, my work, and my contact information.

I learned a lot in the time I created my portfolio. While I knew some HTML and CSS beforehand, it was challenging but also very fun to create an interactive and responsive page from scratch. I applied many things I learned such as media queries, psuedo-classes, variables, and more. I'm particularly proud of being able to utilize the color scheme in a way that looked visually appealing and being able to make my project cards interactive and animated using CSS. At the same time, I didn't want to go overboard with everything so I also decided a simple design would be best, with the main focus being the projects as the user scrolls down. I think this fits my style, as I enjoy more simplistic designs and I believe this is reflected well in my portfolio.

I plan on eventually reuploading this website as my new portfolio once I have updated it and added more projects and experience.

Process
I created a brief wireframe using google docs, and then began researching other porfolios to see how to best execute my vision. I used stackoverflow to understand simple placements, and

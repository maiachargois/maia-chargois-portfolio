My Personal Portfolio
About
This is my personal portfolio showcasing all of my projects throughout my coding career. A portfolio is an excellent way for me to  show off show my work and to add on in the future when I do more projects and get more experience. This portfolio's intention is to give me and future employers a resource to show what I can do and what projects I have been involved in. It's an organized page including a small summary about me, my work, and my contact information.

 While I knew some HTML and CSS beforehand, it was challenging but to create an interactive and responsive page that I could add to in the future. I applied many things I learned such as media queries, psuedo-classes, variables, and more. The main focus of this project was to show all the the projects as the user scrolls down. 

I plan on eventually reuploading this website as my new portfolio once I have updated it and added more projects and experience.
